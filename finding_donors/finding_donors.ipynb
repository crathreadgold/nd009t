    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **<br>\n",
    "<b>Decision Trees</b><br> \n",
    "A real world application of decision trees is to estimate houses that have high energy consumption. Features such as number of people in house, the size, and rooms allows a decision tree to accurately decide when a house consumes a large amount of energy. (http://what-when-how.com/artificial-intelligence/decision-tree-applications-for-data-modelling-artificial-intelligence/)<br> \n",
    "An advantage of decision trees is that it is very tolerant of features that have little effect on the dataset. They are also quite quick to train, which is important considering we have over 30,000 training points and 103 features for each point. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10317885/decision-tree-vs-naive-bayes-classifier, http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)<br>\n",
    "Simple decision trees are prone to overfitting and require a lot of parameter tuning, which increases the time spent creating the model. In addition, simple trees classify in squares so identifying clusters means it has to split a lot (leading to more overfitting).<br>\n",
    "Decision trees are very applicable to this dataset because we have a large number of features. The tree will decide which features provide the most information gain and therefore will ignore feature that have little baring on the classification. Decision trees would have also been able to handle categorical data, although we have created dummy variables in this problem, which reduces the impact. In addition, the tree will not take a long time to train and are easy to understand.<br>\n",
    "<b>SVM</b><br>\n",
    "SVMs have been used to predict diabetes. Features used from a national American dataset include BMI, age, race, and family history. ROC curve auc was as high as 0.83 so SVMs were deemed sufficient to progress for further study. (https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6947-10-16)<br>\n",
    "SVMs deal well with high dimensional data. SVMs are also robust to noise and therefore are not prone to overfitting - they scale well to large datasets.(https://statinfer.com/204-6-8-svm-advantages-disadvantages-applications/)<br>\n",
    "Due to working in high dimensions, especially with non-linear kernals, SVMs can be computationally expensive and therefore take a long time to train. When the number of features is greater than the number of training datapoints, regularization and hyperparameter choice becomes crucial to avoid overfitting.(https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1424949)<br>\n",
    "For this dataset, an SVM is particularly applicable because we have not conducted extensive research on the dimensionality or distribution of the data. SVMs can work linearly (linear kernal) or in higher dimensions (polynomial, rbf kernel). It may be the case that this dataset is complex and cannot be split linearly. SVM gives the ability to adapt hyper-parameters to deal with this, in contrast to models such as logistic regression. We know that ther training sample volume (>30,000) is much greater than the number of features (103) so the chance of overfitting is reduced.<br>\n",
    "<b>Adaboost</b><br>\n",
    "This model has been used to detect basketball players in games. The technique used decision tree weak classifiers. Facial recognition reported over 70% accuracy but analysis on a player's entire body contained too much noise to classify. (https://www.uni-obuda.hu/journal/Markoski_Ivankovic_Ratgeber_Pecev_Glusac_57.pdf)<br>\n",
    "Adaboost using decision tree weak classifiers have been known to be the most accurate out-of-the box classifier. It deals well with lots of irrelevant features and automatically learns from feature interaction. <br>\n",
    "However, this model is very slow to train as it is computationally intense to train many weak classifiers. Some hyper-parameter tuning is required, such as the type of weak classifier. <br>\n",
    "Our dataset's features are likely to be dependent and Adaboost can learn from the interaction of features, which can be of use. In addition, running many decision trees will help to reduce overfitting and the model will deal well with redundant features."

    "The f-score was approximately 0.65 for the Decision Tree, 0.7 for the SVM, and just above 0.7 for the Adaboost classifier. This shows that all models have an ability to predict the true poitives as a ratio of the true positives + false negatives. A beta of 0.5 for the f-score prioritises recall (which makes sense for a charity that cannot let candidates go undetected), and the SVM and Adaboost classifier performs well. SVM and Adaboost also have a higher accuracy on the testing set compared to the Decision Tree. The Decision Tree's high training set accuracy and f-score show a tendency to overfit. Therefore the Decision Tree is not suitable for CharityML.<br>\n",
    "On the full training/testing set, the SVM model had a long training and testing time of nearly 4 minutes. This would not be practical for repeat analysis, nor would it be feasible to do work on much larger datasets. The Adaboost model was a lot quicker and was comparable to the Decision Tree's training time. This is far more practical.<br>\n",
    "The Adaboost algorithm is the most suitable for the dataset. It has an ability to utilise the many features that we are presenting to it but because of the boosting methodology used, it does not succumb to the overfitting that is present when using a single Decision Tree. SVM's are also good in high dimensional spaces and it does not overfit but it takes too long to train and test."

    "Adaboost uses a combination of many separate machine learning models run on the same data together. A common model that is run many times is a decision tree. A decision tree is a way to take a collection of datapoints and to split the data into groups by a process of many binary questions. For example, if we had a zoo, a decision tree would split the group by questions on the animals' characteristics (features). The questions aim to split the group as much as possible - this is called the information gain. For a pig, chicken, zebra, and ostrich, the first question may be whether the animal stands on two legs. This would split the group into a pig and zebra, and a ostrich and chicken. Then different questions can be applied to the different groups. For the pig and zebra, this could be whether they are naturally found in the UK. For the ostrich and chicken, it could be if they typically weigh more than 50kg. We can then predict the animals based on their bipedalism, weight, and origin. <br>\n",
    "Adaboost combines a number of very simple decision trees called weak learners. A weak learner is any decision tree that can predict better than randomly guessing. They tend to be very simple models. In the case of decision trees, the simplicity is usually derived from the number of questions that can be asked to split the data. A weak learner decision tree will usually be limited to one question, which splits the data in two (this is called a decision stump). In the example of the zoo, a weak learner could be a question that asks if the animal has wings - this splits the data into two so is a good question to ask. However, if a datapoint was a chicken, the weak ensemble may predict it as an ostrich, because they both have wings, even though it is not an ostrich. But it would never predict the chicken datapoint as a zebra or pig and it is therefore better than random guessing. <br>\n",
    "The datapoints that were predicted incorrectly by the first weak learner are then prioritised by the second weak learner (they are given higher weights, which means they have an adverse effect on what question is chosen). In our example, this would mean the next weak learner would focus on differentiating between the chicken and the ostrich. It could ask for the natural origin of the animal, which would differentiate between the ostrich and the chicken, but would not be good at differentiating between the zebra and ostrich, and the chicken and pig. The incorrectly predicted datapoints from this second weak learner would then be prioritised for the third wek learner. This process of weak learners predicting simple patterns and increased weights applied to incorrectly predicted datapoints is usually continued hundreds or thousands of times. <br>\n",
    "Each weak learner is given an overall weighting score based on the sum of the weights of the correctly and incorrectly predicted datapoints. The overall weights determine how influential each weak learner is to determine the final (strong) classifier. In our example, the two weak classifiers will be combined. The final strong classifier would ideally combine information from both the weak learners, so that it would be able to predict that an animal with wings and from the UK is a chicken. <br>\n",
    "In our census data, a weak classifier could be the education-num to predict if a person earns over 50,000. However, this could misclasify highly-educated people who have just left education and are looking for a job. But, overall, the weak classifier could have a good error rate (it predicts a large proportion of the dataset well) and therefore has a high overall weighting. The next weak classifier that focuses on the (highly weighted) misclassified datapoints could split the unemployed, highly-educated population from the rest by selecting a threshold for the hours-per-week worked. This may not have a better error rate overall, but it will be good at predicting the misclassified datapoints from the first weak classifier. Therefore, the strong classifier is trained in a way that it knows everyone with a high education level should be predicted to have an income over 50,000 except for those with low hours worked per week. This is because even though the hours-per-week is overall a poorer model, it is good at predicting the misclassified points from the first weak classifier, and therefore the (higher) weighting on these miscalssified points multiplied by the (lower) overall weight of the second classifier is greater than the (lower) weighting of the misclassified points multipled by the (higher) overall first classifier weighting. This process is continued with many different weak classifiers to train a combined strong classifier. <br>\n",
    "When a new datapoint is seen, the final strong classifier is then used to predict the outcome. In our example, the strong classifier knows that all high education datapoints should be predicted to earn over 50,000 except for those with low hours-per-week worked. So a new datapoint that has a masters degree but only works 10 hours, should be predicted not to earn over 50,000 whereas a datapoint with a masters degree and 50 hours worked per week would be predicted to earn over 50,000.\n",

    "Based on my predictions, I predicted age, capital-gain, hours-per-week, and education-num correctly. However, I did not predict capital-loss correctly, which is the best feature to differentiate the data from those who earn over 50,000 to those who do not. In addition, I predicted the order of the feature importance incorrectly. The visualization shows that age would be the second best feature compared to my prediction of the fifth best, hours-per-week fourth rather than my predicted second, and education-num fifth rather than my predicted first. The model shows that a person with a certain amount of capital-loss, a working age range, high capital-gain, high hours-per-week, and a high education-num is most likely to have an income over 50,000."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*."
